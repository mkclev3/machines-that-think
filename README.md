# Final Project: AI versus Art
In this project, I'll be exploring how thinking machines attempt to create art. Me personally, I consider art to be the byproducts of humans attempting to express how they understand the world, or capture the human experience and connect to the experiences of others. I'm not quite sure how to put this eloquently and in a way that doesn't sound like platitudes, but I think for something to be Art, it has to be an expression of your own perspective, emotions, and experiences. By this criteria, whatever AI creates will not and cannot be Art, as it is cannot culminate from emotions and experiences, since, obviously, AI doesn't have any. It will be a knock-off of someone else's product, but it won't be able to capture the emotion or uniqueness of the creators touch. I'm trying to think of a good similie, and the best I come up with is it's like trying to create a rainbow without the "light" of human ingenuity. You can replicate the other conditions perfectly; rain, the air, but still you'll be left with something colorless. I don't think that similie really landed, but! What I'm trying to say is that no matter what prompts I use, the art created will feel soulless.

During this project, I think I might be surprised by how much AI art has grown since I've last messed around with it, or surprised with how close AI can get to creating the Art I'm trying to get it to. However, I'm confident my opinions on weather AI art is art at all will be unchanged.

<h3>Art Inspiration </h3>

**Ecstasy**


<img src="img/Ecstasy OG">


<sub> A 1927 oil painting by Matthew Parrish, titled "Ecstasy"</sub>

The feelings this painting creates for me are freedom, wonder, and the excitement of adventure. Specifically, this painting reminds me of the feeling you get when you‚Äôve been sitting for too long, but you finally get up and go outside to run in the grass barefoot, and its windy and you've got so much energy and just such a perfect day. Elation is maybe the word I'm looking for, although Ecstasy is a very fitting one too. 

I really love this painting- it‚Äôs got such a Maxfield Parrish look. All of his mountains look the same, which I find funny. I also think her dress is very weird- it's flowy but it looks crusty and it doesn't make much physical sense. It definitely looks like a man painted it, methinks. It reminds me of snowy mountains, or a continuation of the mountains in the background.

The obvious highlight of the painting is the figure itself. You can tell exacly how free she's feeling by the look in her face. Something I've found myself really admiring about this painting is this sense of peaceful and unmarred femininity. I feel like a lot of similar art pieces, even those made by humans, fail to capture a sense of feminine grace and innocence that doesn't feel sexualized. AI, I believe, will be wholly unable to capture her happiness (without feeling hollow or over-the-top) and her particular brand of beauty (innocence? I can't find a word that I think is fitting). These things are the most impressive parts of the painting, and without them I doubt it'll feel beautiful or unique at all. 

Another prediction I have is that AI won't be able to find a way to create a woman that isn't the face of conventional beauty. Not to say the subject of the painting isn't beautiful, but I think whoever AI creates will be a copy-paste of modern beauty standards, no matter what I tell it to do. That's something I've noticed about AI art historically, and it leaves me wondering if it'll have the same problem when creating men. 

**The Last Unicorn**


<img src="img/Unicorn OG">


<sub> A Scene from 1982 film "The Last Unicorn" </sub>

"The Last Unicorn" is one of the animated movies we had on repeat when I was a kid, and it remains one of my favorites. Its got lots of problems though, so please don't quote me on that, but I‚Äôm still a fan of the art. 

Looking at this scene makes me feel sad. I‚Äôm reminded of a feeling of melancholy, peace, and maybe a little bit of despair.

In this scene, the unicorn has been wandering alone for a long time, attempting to find another creature like her and unaware that she's the only one left. Even if you don't know the context -and despite the fact that the face of the unicorn is unable to create normal expressions- the lighting, the environment, and her body language are enough to invoke these emotions. 

I think its absolutely gorgeous, especially the color and lighting choices. Similar to ‚Äúecstasy,‚Äù something I really love about this piece is how graceful and ethereal the unicorn seems. I feel like I could stare at this frame for forever; its strangely hypnotizing. I also love the stylistic choice to make a monochrome and semi-abstracted (simplified?) background. It's very unique, and the contrast between the simple shapes and dark color of the background and the bright white and more detailed form of the unicorn is especially beautiful. It pops!

I think the unique art style and emotion without facial expression will be what AI struggles with the most when trying to create a similar piece, and the lack of these two elements will make it uninteresting and emotionless.


**Nadeesh Prabou Watercolor**

<sub> A watercolor painting of a rainy day by Nadeesh Prabou </sub>

I love the atmosphere of this painting. It‚Äôs so dark, moody, and gorgeous; I can almost smell the rain. I love the pop of the neon lights, the movement of the windswept trees, and the contrast the the raincoat creates. This painting, even though it‚Äôs a little chaotic, still feels peaceful. All of the colors are slightly muted by the rainy weather, which contributes to the feeling of peace. The muted colors, the contrast directing your eyes to the figure, and the relative simplicity of the painting all, to me, create a sense of melencholy and longing. It also feels a bit like a dreamscape because of the hazy edges and the simple lighting and color scheme.

Watercolor behaves very differently to other paint mediums, and it's used flawlessly here. I'm curios to see if AI has been trained much with it, or if it ends up looking like its an actual watercolor at all.


**We Live, We Die**

<img src="img/Bones OG">


<sub>A digital painting by tumblr user @bc-jpeg, part of a collection of paintings titled "we live, we die" </sub>

This last painting is fanart by an artist I‚Äôve been following for a while, @bc-jpeg. This particular piece is fanart of a creator I don‚Äôt really follow, but its so cool! It does have a bit of a tumblr-esc style, but good art is good art, so I'll tolerate no complaints or slander.

A quick ode (not rlly tho) to fanart: fanart has the superpower of being connected to stories that the audience already knows and loves, and I feel that, often, it gives artists the sense that they can skip the "context" while painting, and explore more dramatic or unique subjects. Fanart, even the top percent of it thats really really good, is so fantastical and emotional and dramatic, and I love that, and I love the freedom that gives for creators and the support for artists that it generates.

I love the lighting in this one so much, and I think it‚Äôs very well made. Its dynamic, its got beautiful lighting, and a good understanding of form. When I first saw it, I spent 10 minutes just trying to figure out their process and what I liked so much about it. I love the sort of anxiety-inducing (??) quality of this piece. Looking at it I‚Äôm reminded of the feeling of pent up emotions, or the feeling of almost being this close ü§è to losing it. I think the subject looks angry but resigned, which is maybe a combination ai won‚Äôt be as accustomed to. He looks very cold, and it feels powerful, in a way. Like that feeling when you absolutely obliterate something and are like yea, im unstoppable, its no biggie. 

I‚Äôm interested to see how AI attempts to replicate such a subtle but powerful emotion (/vibe?), and if I'll be able to get it to make anything that has that semi-realism tumblr-would-love-this style.

<h2> An AI Attempt </h2>

Now, AI will put forth it's valiant effort at creating art that doesn't suck.



<h3>Ecstasy: AI Edition</h3>


<img src="img/mountains1">


**Prompt:** Create an image of a girl with long brown hair blowing in the wind and a white billowing dress that wraps around her body standing on the edge of a cliff. The girl is in profile view, and she is standing on her toes. She's standing beneath a blue sky with puffy white clouds, and in the background, there are mountains that are orange and brown, and look scraggly and rough. Its in the style of neo-classical oil painting, and the colors are very saturated. The girl is smiling at the sky and has her hands in her hair. She looks like she feels free


<img src="img/mountains2">


**Prompt:** Make it in profile,not landscape. The girl is standing even more sideways, and looks younger. The dress is a similar texture to the mountains, and looks a lot less smooth.

<h3>The Last Unicorn: AI Edition**</h3>


<img src="img/Unicorn0">


**Prompt:** Create an image of a white unicorn that's elegant and ethereal, that's standing on a mountain at night, with trees that are abstract in the background, and a full moon overhead. It's nighttime, and everything is dark blue except for the unicorn, who is illuminated by the light of the moon. 



<img src="img/Unicorn AI">


**Prompt:** Do it again, but make the mood more melancholy, and make the painting more dark blue, and the lines should be less harsh. It should be drawn in the style of 80s 2d animation

<h3>Rainy Watercolor: AI Edition</h3>


<img src="img/watercolor1">


**Prompt:** Create an image of a watercolor painting of a rainy day. The focus of the image is a man with a black umbrella, an orange shirt, and a spotted dog walking in front of him, crossing the road. The entire painting is green tinged, and cars are driving past the road, with their headlights causing red and yellow reflections on the damp pavement. In the background, you can see palm trees being blown in strong wind, and the outline of a building. The painting feels melancholy, and kind of hazy.


<img src="img/watercolor2">


**Prompt:** Make it much more undetailed and zoomed out. Make it more watercolor-y and make the entire thing far more green!


<img src="img/watercolor3">


**Prompt:** Make the trees blowing in the wind, the building smaller, and the man should be crossing the street in profile view, not walking down the middle.

<h3>We Live, We Die: AI Edition</h3>


<img src="img/Bones AI">


**Prompt:** Generate an image of an elegant man with a mustache who is wearing a suit, in the dark. He facing to the side, and is reaching through 3 separate glowing skeletons, who are all going through states of agony. The skeletons are red, pink, and purple. The image is digitally painted, with black sketch lines still visible, and colorful light creating stark contrast. He appears angry but subdued.
