<h3>Human-Made Art Inspiration </h3>

**Ecstasy**

<sub> A 1927 oil painting by Matthew Parrish, titled "Ecstasy"</sub>

This first piece is called “Ecstasy”, and its a 1929 oil painting by Maxfield Parrish. This actually wasn’t the oil painting I was looking for, but I couldn’t find the other one, and I’m a big fan of this one too. The feeling this painting reminds me of is childlike wonder, and I don’t really know what the name of the feeling is, but when you’ve been sitting for too long and you finally go outside and run in the grass barefoot, and its windy and just such a perfect day. The feeling of elation I guess? I just really love this painting. It’s got such a Maxfield Parrish look- all of his mountains look the same, which I find funny. But the obvious highlight of the painting is the figure itself– I love the weird cloud like and physics-defying dress, I love how happy she looks, and maybe this is strange, but I love her femininity. She’s so graceful, and it doesn’t feel sexualized or icky at all. I feel like I can feel her sense of freedom through the painting. I also think her dress is very weird- it's flowy but it looks crusty almost? And it just doesn't make sense at all. To me it looks like snowy mountains, or like a continuation of the ones in the background? Like she's sorta one with mountains, or is her own mountain. I love the form! I love the emotion! I think it’ll be a struggle for AI to figure out both the anatomy and the emotion of this.


**The Last Unicorn**

<sub> A Scene from 1982 film "The Last Unicorn" </sub>

This is a scene from the movie “The Last Unicorn” (1982), one of the animated movies we had on repeat when I was a kid. The movie has plenty of problems, but I’m still a fan of the art. Looking at this scene makes me feel strangely sad. I’m reminded of a feeling of melancholy, peace, and maybe a little bit of despair. In this scene, the unicorn has been wandering alone for a long time and wishes to be reunited with the other unicorns. Even if you haven’t seen the movie, though, you can tell what she’s feeling just by looking at it, even though it's a weird mythical deer-horse unicorn thing. I think its is absolutely gorgeous, especially the lighting. Similar to “ecstasy,” something I really love about this piece is how graceful and ethereal the unicorn seems. I feel like I could stare at this frame for forever, its strangely hypnotizing. I also LOVE the trees and the background. Its got such a 1980s animation feel, I miss when movies were animated that way. It pops! Its just so gorgeous and so sad. And like mysterious 


**Nadeesh Prabou Watercolor**

<sub> A Watercolor of a rainy day by Nadeesh Prabou </sub>

This is a watercolor painting by Nadeesh Prabou that I love, although I don’t know and couldn’t find the name of. It’s so moody and gorgeous– I love the neon light of the cars, the windswept trees, and the contrast of the raincoat of the person walking. I can picture how this scene smells while I look at it. Its so beautiful, and I’m a big fan of watercolors. They’re strangely simple but can still be so challenging to learn. They’re used so beautifully here. I love rainy weather too, and this painting, even though it’s a little chaotic, still feels peaceful. It makes me feel like closing my eyes and lying down outside, or running through the rain, or stand under a tree and hear the rain pitter-patter on the leaves. Again, not sure how to describe this feeling? I guess longing, again a bit of melancholy, as I personally feel like all rain brings me. It also feels like a dreamscape to me.

This last painting is a digital piece by an artist I’ve been following for a while, [insert tumblr]. This particular piece is a fanart of a creator I don’t really follow, but I wanted to include at least one piece that’s a digital fanart piece because even if it’s a little silly I’m absolutely obsessed with good fanart. Everyone can connect to them so much more than with most random pieces, even if the radom pieces are better done. I know and love the story, so I feel so much more while looking at the piece. I also just love emotional and dramatic and sometimes slightly fantastical people art. It’s just so cool, they make me so happy. I love the lighting in this one so much, and I think it’s very well done. When I first saw it, I spent 10 minutes just trying to figure out their process and what I liked so much about it. I love the sort of anxiety-inducing?? Quality of this one. Looking at it I’m reminded of the feeling of pent up emotions, or the feeling of almost being this close to losing it. I love the fantastical, swishy?? Vibe of it. 
I also feel like he looks angry but resigned, which is maybe a combination ai won’t be as accustomed to. He looks very cold, and it feels powerful? In a way. Like that feeling when u absolutely obliterate someone and are like yea, im unstoppable, its no biggie. I’m interested to see how AI attempts to replicate such a subtle emotion.

<h3> An AI Attempt </h3>

Now, AI will put forth it's valiant effort at creating art that doesn't suck
