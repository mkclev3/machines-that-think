# Final Project: AI versus Art
In this project, I'll be exploring how thinking machines attempt to create art. Me personally, I consider art to be the byproducts of humans attempting to express how they understand the world around them. I'm not quite sure how to put this eloquently and in a way that doesn't sound like platitudes, but I think for something to be Art, it has to be an expression of your own perspective, emotions, and experiences. By this criteria, whatever AI creates will not and cannot be Art, as it is cannot culminate from emotions and experiences, since, obviously, AI doesn't have any. It will be a knock-off of someone else's product, but it won't be able to capture the emotion or uniqueness of the creators touch. I'm trying to think of a good similie, and the best I come up with is it's like trying to create a rainbow without the "light" of human ingenuity. You can replicate the other conditions perfectly; rain, the air, but still you'll be left with something colorless. I don't think that similie really landed, but! What I'm trying to say is that no matter what prompts I use, the art created will feel soulless.

During this project, I think I might be surprised by how much AI art has grown since I've last messed around with it, or surprised with how close AI can get to creating the Art I'm trying to get it to. However, I'm confident my opinions on weather AI art is art at all will be unchanged.

**Ecstasy**

<sub> A 1927 oil painting by Matthew Parrish, titled "Ecstasy"</sub>

The feelings this painting creates for me are freedom, wonder, and the excitement of adventure. Specifically, this painting reminds me of the feeling you get when you’ve been sitting for too long, but you finally get up and go outside to run in the grass barefoot, and its windy and you've got so much energy and just such a perfect day. Elation is maybe the word I'm looking for, although Ecstasy is a very fitting one too. 

I really love this painting- it’s got such a Maxfield Parrish look. All of his mountains look the same, which I find funny. I also think her dress is very weird- it's flowy but it looks crusty and it doesn't make much physical sense. It definitely looks like a man painted it, methinks. It reminds me of snowy mountains, or a continuation of the mountains in the background.

The obvious highlight of the painting is the figure itself. You can tell exacly how free she's feeling by the look in her face. Something I've found myself really admiring about this painting is this sense of peaceful and unmarred femininity. I feel like a lot of similar art pieces, even those made by humans, fail to capture a sense of feminine grace and innocence that doesn't feel sexualized. AI, I believe, will be wholly unable to capture her happiness (without feeling hollow or over-the-top) and her particular brand of beauty (innocence? I can't find a word that I think is fitting). These things are the most impressive parts of the painting, and without them I doubt it'll feel beautiful or unique at all. 

Another prediction I have is that AI won't be able to find a way to create a woman that isn't the face of conventional beauty. Not to say the subject of the painting isn't beautiful, but I think whoever AI creates will be a copy-paste of modern beauty standards, no matter what I tell it to do. That's something I've noticed about AI art historically, and it leaves me wondering if it'll have the same problem when creating men. 

**The Last Unicorn**

<sub> A Scene from 1982 film "The Last Unicorn" </sub>

This is a scene from the movie “The Last Unicorn” (1982), one of the animated movies we had on repeat when I was a kid. The movie has plenty of problems, but I’m still a fan of the art. Looking at this scene makes me feel strangely sad. I’m reminded of a feeling of melancholy, peace, and maybe a little bit of despair. In this scene, the unicorn has been wandering alone for a long time and wishes to be reunited with the other unicorns. Even if you haven’t seen the movie, though, you can tell what she’s feeling just by looking at it, even though it's a weird mythical deer-horse unicorn thing. I think its is absolutely gorgeous, especially the lighting. Similar to “ecstasy,” something I really love about this piece is how graceful and ethereal the unicorn seems. I feel like I could stare at this frame for forever, its strangely hypnotizing. I also LOVE the trees and the background. Its got such a 1980s animation feel, I miss when movies were animated that way. It pops! Its just so gorgeous and so sad. And like mysterious 


**Nadeesh Prabou Watercolor**

<sub> A Watercolor of a rainy day by Nadeesh Prabou </sub>

DRAFT This is a watercolor painting by Nadeesh Prabou that I love, although I don’t know and couldn’t find the name of. It’s so moody and gorgeous– I love the neon light of the cars, the windswept trees, and the contrast of the raincoat of the person walking. I can picture how this scene smells while I look at it. Its so beautiful, and I’m a big fan of watercolors. They’re strangely simple but can still be so challenging to learn. They’re used so beautifully here. I love rainy weather too, and this painting, even though it’s a little chaotic, still feels peaceful. It makes me feel like closing my eyes and lying down outside, or running through the rain, or stand under a tree and hear the rain pitter-patter on the leaves. Again, not sure how to describe this feeling? I guess longing, again a bit of melancholy, as I personally feel like all rain brings me. It also feels like a dreamscape to me.


**Breaking Bones**

<sub> [copy in description] </sub>

DRAFT This last painting is a digital piece by an artist I’ve been following for a while, [insert tumblr]. This particular piece is a fanart of a creator I don’t really follow, but I wanted to include at least one piece that’s a digital fanart piece because even if it’s a little silly I’m absolutely obsessed with good fanart. Everyone can connect to them so much more than with most random pieces, even if the radom pieces are better done. I know and love the story, so I feel so much more while looking at the piece. I also just love emotional and dramatic and sometimes slightly fantastical people art. It’s just so cool, they make me so happy. I love the lighting in this one so much, and I think it’s very well done. When I first saw it, I spent 10 minutes just trying to figure out their process and what I liked so much about it. I love the sort of anxiety-inducing?? Quality of this one. Looking at it I’m reminded of the feeling of pent up emotions, or the feeling of almost being this close to losing it. I love the fantastical, swishy?? Vibe of it. 
I also feel like he looks angry but resigned, which is maybe a combination ai won’t be as accustomed to. He looks very cold, and it feels powerful? In a way. Like that feeling when u absolutely obliterate someone and are like yea, im unstoppable, its no biggie. I’m interested to see how AI attempts to replicate such a subtle emotion.

<h3> An AI Attempt </h3>

Now, AI will put forth it's valiant effort at creating art that doesn't suck
